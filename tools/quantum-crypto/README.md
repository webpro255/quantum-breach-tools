## 📦 Included Tools

### 1. 🔢 modinv.py
- 📍 **Path**: `modinv.py`
- 🧮 **Purpose**: Calculates the modular inverse of two integers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- 🧪 **Use Case**: Common in RSA and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) problems.
- 🧰 **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 modinv.py <a> <modulus>
  ```

  python3 modinv.py 3 11
➜ Modular inverse of 3 mod 11 is: 4

### Usage Notes

- This toolkit is designed for manual use and scripting in CTF environments.
- Each tool is standalone and easy to edit for specific challenge scenarios.
- Python 3+ is required.
- Pull requests are welcome from Quantum Breach team members.
